Abstract
As below we introduce a self-configuration computer network framework over multi agent system for diagnostic, optimization, management of computer network. The system follow many steps as collect information of workstations, server and active equipment of network. With the information that was taken, we refine through parsing, standardize, filtering for reach our goal. As support, we define a data model who allow keep the relevant data for decision process. An optimization model is a key ó mechanism for achieve a decision process. The multi agent system involve a process of solve many problems on simultaneous way and use distributed capacity for deploy that solutions. As conclusions, it´s feasible reach a goal, providing and deploying solution a self-configuration over network in a distributed way for a multiple task. When each agent takes a job, doesn’t need a central control. When a computer network come into a partition state (two o many separate pieces), each piece must resolve their interconnection problems as a health, stability or self-diagnostic.
