# Abstract
In this work, a self-configuration computer network framework over a multi agent system for diagnostic, optimization and management was developed. The system follows serval steps such as collecting information from workstations, servers and other active equipment in network. This information is refined through parsing, standardization and then a data model is defined which who allows to keep the relevant data for the decision process. An optimization model is a key mechanism for achieving decision process. The multi agent system involves a process of solving simultaneously several problems and uses its distributed capacity for deploying a solutions. As a conclusion, it was possible to reach the goal, providing and deploying a self-configuration system on a network in a distributed way. When each agent does a job, it does not need a central control. When a computer network come into a partition state (two o many separate pieces), each piece must resolve their interconnection problems such as well-functioning, stability or self-diagnostic.
